# Predict Default Rates

## Description

An upcoming financial institution wants to specialize in student loans and has contacted us in September of 2013 to look at their data.<br/>
You are given three datasets:
* college_features_2012_2013/2013_2014: contains general information about US colleges
* loans_2012_2013: contains the amount and type of loans given to students studying at US colleges
* default_rates_2012_2013/2011_2012: contains default rates of student loans studying at US colleges

In `notebook.ipynb` 6 questions are answered based on the datasets:

### Q1: If given the chance, what would you try to predict, given this dataset? How would you try to achieve this? (you can suggest multiple possibilities, ranked by importance)

### Q2: Why is this relevant to the company's bottom line? Explain the impact of an accurate prediction on the company's workflow and rudimentarily formulate its influence on company profits mathematically. 

### Q3: Find and display graphically as many relevant insights as possible. What is contained in your graphs and why are your conclusions important? 

### Q4: If you had to set a fixed interest rate per school for the coming year (2013-2014), what would have to be the minimum for each school in order to break even? (hint: you will need to predict default rates, include these results in your answer)

### Q5: Assuming you could have a monopoly on loans for students enrolled at one of five universities next year (2013-2014), what universities would you pick and why? (assuming all loans get charged the same rate of 7%)?

### Q6: Assuming every school gets assigned to a category that determines the interest rate charged on its students' loans, how would you define those categories and how many would there be? Rank these categories by assigned interest rate and display your reasoning graphically.

## Requirements
The application has been developed in Python 3.
